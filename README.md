# Ruckless

Suckless Tools, rewritten in Rust.

## rinit

This is a fairly straight port of Suckless Tools' 'sinit', from C to Rust.

Changes from sinit:

* Config centralised (but still semi-hardcoded rather than requiring config files)
* Debug mode added, based on the above config.
* More error/result checking and diagnostics added, as befits Rust.


## Other tools from the Suckless suite

May or may not come later.
